*** Lore
I was in a voice chat with friends and one of them had the nickname "ralsay" (based off of Ralsei),
I made a joke suggesting for them to make a tool called "ralsay" based off of cowsay, and they had done it... in Lua?!
Earlier, I was talking about how I never really got to use Rust, and one of my other friends was a Rust shill.
Once the project was finished by "ralsay", I was going to rewrite it in Python, but then that same friend suggested Rust.

So here I am, now learning rust with a cowsay close based off of a Deltarune character.

*** Running
Install Rust and Cargo, a common way of doing this is with the rustup toolchain.

Once you have installed Cargo, build it by running the below command:
#+BEGIN_SRC
  % cargo build --release
  % ./target/release/ralsay-rs
#+END_SRC
